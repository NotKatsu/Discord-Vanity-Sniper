Get rare discord vanities with ease, fast and efficient sniping is easy with discord vanity sniper. 

## About
Discord Vanity Snipers are a way to get vanities once they are no longer being used, they might be not used for a few reasons including loosing 15 boosts, changing it to a different server etc. 

The point in a Vanity Sniper is to take the vanity and put it on your server before anyone else can, this Vanity Sniper uses python and httpx to make it somewhat fast, it is not the fastest but will beat people changing the vanity by hand and some other vanity snipers, the tool is fast but not as fast as some snipers.


## Installation

Download the project files then open config.json

```bash
{
    "token": "MTY3NDUwNzk4MjY5MTcyMTky.AjgbGD.1cM5xa_j-PSyrGBm7zbCn6f3XQH", 
    "guild_id": 8133692280895029513,
    "debugging": true,

    "vanities": ["discord", "vanity", "sniper"]
}
```

Edit the config to look a little something like this.
    
## Run the program
```bash
python sniper.py 
OR 
python3 sniper.py
```

## NOTE:
The Vanity Sniper works however it was a proof of concept to show friends what can be done through the API and to show that the Discord API needs to be changed to prevent this kind of stuff, by using the sniper you accept full responsibility, I have not and will not use it on the production version of the Discord API and do not recommend it either.
